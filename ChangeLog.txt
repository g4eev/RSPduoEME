 RSPduoEME Change Record:

 18/06/2020 Version 1.0 Baseline

 30/06/2020 Version 1.1

 Added Modes 6 & 7 to allow Channela A or B Soundcard output, as well as UDP output.
 Added RealTime processing priority to process and DSP threads.
 Added Overload indicator to MainWindow Display, deleted corresponding text warnings in Status Display.

 21/08/2020 Version 1.2

 Updated sdrplay_api.h and rspduointerface.cpp to allow SDRplay API versions 3.06 and above to be recognised
 as a result of the release of SDRplay API version 3.07 on 14/4/2020. No code was changed as SRPplay advise no
 changes to the Windows interface in version 3.07.

 21/09/2020 Version 1.3

 Added Linrad RAW16 output mode via UDP and 4 channel Soundcard output. Corrected US6 filter output which was out
 by one sample causing a periodic plip in output data. Rearranged phase display buffer to load from DSP thread
 circular buffers and pointer from respective UDP and Soundcard output modes (display and lock is against TIMF2 data).
 Note: Linrad needs to run on a seperate computer when using RAW16 UDP output, due to clash of mode data
 server port (49812); Thre may be an issue with network performance for RAW16 UDP as I had issues with Raspberry Pi and
 slow network?

 19/11/2020 Version 1.31

 Added control of calibrator via simple serial port command. When selected the program outputs the calibration frequency
 (in KHz) at 9600 baud, 8bit, no parity, format. When no calibration signal is required the output is set for 4GHz. Auto
 calibration when ticked, will automatically set the phase when the cal signal variation is less than 5 degrees.

 To Consider for Future: Seperate gain for each channel, frequency setting below 1KHz for Xtal error.
